![FIGURE 1. Illustrating (a) the framework for the research process, which encompasses the identification of related works, methodology, results, discussion,
limitations and future work—and their branches, and (b) the process of identifying works related to paddy disease segmentation and classification (literature review,
research gap identification, and analysis of selected classification and segmentation models.)](paper_figures/paper_layout/paper_layout.jpg)
